# golem-reader
Android newsreader for reading articles from https://golem.de. 

Some stuff to do (not complete):
- Replace deprecated calls (especially AsyncTask, use https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/coroutines)
- Refactor code (architecture)
- Refurbish article view (maybe do not use the bare HTML we get for rendering, but that is not easy)
- Native comment parsing
